# kiva-raspi
RaspberryPi powered map that lights up in real time with loans

## Setup

Put the pins in:
```
# Reading the code in main.py is best to ensure up to date..
PIN_NORTH_AMERICA = 2
PIN_SOUTH_AMERICA = 3
PIN_AFRICA = 4
PIN_MIDDLE_EAST = 14
PIN_EAST_ASIA = 18
```

Use a common ground.

## Example command to run it on startup:
Edit ```/etc/rc.local```
(You can change it to accept bash commands (like pushd and popd) by changing the first line to ```#!/bin/bash```

```
#!/bin/bash

# Go to directory with your code and save current directory onto the stack
pushd /home/pi/kiva-raspi/      
# Runs python command put the output and error output into dev/null (no where) and create a seperate thread so itâ€™s not blocking.
python main.py > /dev/null 2>&1 &
# return to previous pushed directory
popd   
exit 0
```
